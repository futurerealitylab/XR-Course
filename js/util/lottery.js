morning of twenty seven was clear and sunny with the fresh warmth of a full summer day the flowers 
were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green people of the village began to gather in 
the square between the post office and the bank around ten o'clock in some towns there were so many 
people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on second but in this village where there 
were only about three hundred people the whole lottery took less than two hours so it could begin at ten 
o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner 


children assembled first of course was recently over for the summer and the feeling of 
liberty sat uneasily on most of them they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke 
into boisterous play and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher of books and reprimands 
had already stuffed his pockets full of stones and the other boys soon followed his 
example selecting the smoothest and roundest stones and and the 
villagers pronounced this name eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the 
square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys girls stood aside talking among themselves 
looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters 


the men began to gather surveying their own children speaking of planting and rain tractors and 
taxes stood together away from the pile of stones in the corner and their jokes were quiet and they 
smiled rather than laughed women wearing faded house dresses and sweaters came shortly after 
their menfolk greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands 
the women standing by their husbands began to call to their children and the children came 
reluctantly having to be called four or five times ducked under his mother grasping hand 
and ran laughing back to the pile of stones father spoke up sharply and came quickly and 
took his place between his father and his oldest brother 


lottery was conducted as were the square dances the teen club the program by 
who had time and energy to devote to civic activities was a round faced jovial man and he 
ran the coal business and people were sorry for him because he had no children and his wife was a 
scold he arrived in the square carrying the black wooden box there was a murmur of 
conversation among the villagers and he waved and called late today folks postmaster 
followed him carrying a three legged stool and the stool was put in the center of the square and 
set the black box down on it villagers kept their distance leaving a space between 
themselves and the stool and when said of you fellows want to give me a hand 
there was a hesitation before two men and his oldest son came forward to hold the 
box steady on the stool while stirred up the papers inside it 


original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago and the black box now resting on the 
stool had been put into use even before the oldest man in town was born 
spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box but no one liked to upset even as 
much tradition as was represented by the black box was a story that the present box had been 
made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it the one that had been constructed when the first 
people settled down to make a village here year after the lottery began talking 
again about a new box but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything being done 


black box grew shabbier each year by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly 
along one side to show the original wood color and in some places faded or stained 


and his oldest son held the black box securely on the stool until had 
stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand so much of the ritual had been forgotten or 
discarded had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood 
that had been used for generations of wood had argued had been all very well 
when the village was tiny but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on 
growing it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into he black box night before 
the lottery and made up the slips of paper and put them in the box and it was 
then taken to the safe of coal company and locked up until was ready to take 
it to the square next morning rest of the year the box was put way sometimes one place sometimes 
another it had spent one year in barn and another year underfoot in the post office and 
sometimes it was set on a shelf in the grocery and left there 


was a great deal of fussing to be done before declared the lottery open were 
the lists to make up of heads of families heads of households in each family members of each 
household in each family was the proper swearing in of by the postmaster as the 
official of the lottery at one time some people remembered there had been a recital of some sort 
performed by the official of the lottery a perfunctory tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each 
year some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it 
others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people but years and years ago this part of the 
ritual had been allowed to lapse had been also a ritual salute which the official of the lottery had 
had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box but this also had changed with 
time until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching 
was very good at all this in his clean white shirt and blue jeans with one hand resting 
carelessly on the black box he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to 
and the 


as finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers came 
hurriedly along the path to the square her sweater thrown over her shoulders and slid into place in the 
back of the crowd forgot what day it was she said to who stood next to her and 
they both laughed softly my old man was out back stacking wood went on 
and then looked out the window and the kids was gone and then remembered it was the twenty 
seventh and came a running dried her hands on her apron and said re in time 
though re still talking away up there 


craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing 
near the front tapped on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through 
the crowd people separated good humoredly to let her through two or three people said in voices 
just loud enough to be heard across the crowd comes your and she 
made it after all reached her husband and who had been waiting said 
cheerfully we were going to have to get on without you said

quiet wetting their lips not looking around raised one hand high and said 
man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward said and 
said grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously reached 
into the black box and took out a folded paper held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went
